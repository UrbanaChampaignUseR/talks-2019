## Mission

The mission of the Urbana-Champaign UseR (UC-UR) group is to foster a 
constructive and collaborative environment for users and developers of the _R_ 
language. We seek to faciliate the free exchange of ideas, developments, and
best practices surrounding _R_ in the Urbana-Champaign area and to the greater
_R_ community at large. Everyone who is interested in _R_ should gain newfound
knowledge by attending.
